# Refine Design — Design Pass

## Overview

Pulls **live design context directly from the Figma MCP** and translates it into implementation-ready specs aligned with the Stetsom design system. Always fetches from Figma — never reads local snapshot files as the source of truth.

**Core principle:** Design truth lives in Figma. Always read it fresh. Local files are caches — treat them as potentially stale.

---

## When to Use

- Task file has `Needs design pass: YES`
- Implementation diverged visually from the Figma reference
- A new component needs to match an existing Figma spec
- User provides a Figma URL or component name for visual alignment
- Periodic design consistency check across pages

---

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Resolve Figma Target

**If a Figma URL was provided as argument:**
- Parse `fileKey` and `nodeId` from the URL.
- Use directly in Step 2.

**If no URL was provided:**
- Read `docs/ia/figma/meta.json` to get `figmaFileKey` and the node IDs for the relevant page/section from `websiteSection.pages`.
- Construct the target: `fileKey = huD41oTL0FAa7xsNEK8tAM`, `nodeId` = the section or frame node from `meta.json`.
- DO NOT read `DESIGN_SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md` or any other local snapshot as the source of truth — use them only to know which node IDs to query.

> If the `/figma` skill is available, invoke it first to understand the MCP API capabilities before calling tools directly.

### Step 2 — Fetch Live Design from Figma MCP

Use `get_design_context` (primary) and `get_screenshot` (visual reference):

```
get_design_context(fileKey, nodeId)
get_screenshot(fileKey, nodeId)
```

Retrieve:
- Component hierarchy and structure
- Colors (exact hex → map to project tokens)
- Spacing and padding values (px → convert to Tailwind canonical)
- Typography (font family, weight, size, transform)
- Screenshot for visual ground-truth

**Never substitute a local file read for an MCP call.** Local snapshots are caches.

### Step 3 — Perform Analysis

Produce a precise, general design analysis covering:

1. **Layout fidelity** — does the implementation match Figma's structure, grid, and alignment?
2. **Color accuracy** — are all colors mapped to the correct project tokens? Flag any hardcoded values.
3. **Typography** — correct font family, weight, size, and transform?
4. **Spacing / padding** — convert all Figma px values to Tailwind canonical classes.
5. **Responsive behavior** — mobile vs desktop frames differ?
6. **Component quality** — validate against `/frontend-design` and `/ui-ux-pro-max` standards (padding hierarchy, visual rhythm, interaction states, accessibility).

> Figma is visually correct but can have non-standard paddings or layout quirks. Use `/frontend-design` and `/ui-ux-pro-max` to validate and improve where needed — don't blindly copy Figma pixel-for-pixel if it violates design system standards.

Token mapping reference:

| Figma value              | Project class                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `#E8132A` / Stetsom Red  | `text-brand` / `bg-brand`           |
| `#121212` / Stetsom Dark | `bg-brand-dark` / `text-brand-dark` |
| `#F5F4F2` / Off White    | `bg-off-white`                      |
| `#F8F8F8`                | `bg-card`                           |
| `#565656`                | `text-muted-foreground`             |
| `#B8B8B8`                | `text-text-subtle-dark`             |
| Barlow                   | `font-sans`                         |
| Barlow Condensed         | `font-sans-condensed`               |

### Step 4 — Produce Design Spec

Output a structured spec:

```
## Design Spec: <Component / Page Name>

### Layout
- <structure, grid, alignment notes>

### Colors
- Background: <token>
- Text: <token>
- Accent: <token>

### Typography
- Heading: font-sans-condensed font-black text-[Xpx] uppercase
- Body: font-sans text-base text-muted-foreground

### Spacing
- Padding: <tailwind canonical classes — never [Npx]>
- Gap: <tailwind canonical classes>

### Responsive
- Mobile (<frame node>): <behavior>
- Desktop (<frame node>): <behavior>

### Issues Found
- [ ] <design issue 1>
- [ ] <design issue 2>

### Screenshot reference
[Captured from Figma — see above]
```

### Step 5 — Validate Against Project Rules

Before handing off, confirm the spec:

- Uses Tailwind classes only — no arbitrary color values
- Uses brand tokens from `globals.css`
- No hardcoded hex values
- Spacing converted to canonical classes (N/4 formula)
- Typography uses `font-sans` / `font-sans-condensed` — never inline `fontFamily`
- Padding/gap values match Tailwind canonical (see `.claude/rules/tailwind-canonical.md`)

### Step 6 — Update Local Context Files (if stale)

After fetching live data, check whether local files are outdated:

- `docs/ia/figma/DESIGN_SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md` — update color/typography sections if Figma values differ
- `docs/ia/figma/PAGES_REFERENCE.md` — update node IDs or section descriptions if changed
- `src/app/globals.css` — add missing CSS custom properties for any new tokens found

Only update what actually changed. Do not rewrite entire files from scratch.

### Step 7 — Present Action Plan and Ask How to Proceed

List every issue found as a numbered action plan, then **ask the user how to proceed** — do not auto-execute:

```
## Plano de Ação

1. Fix <issue 1> in <file> — <specific change>
2. Fix <issue 2> in <file> — <specific change>
...

Como você prefere prosseguir?
A) Criar tasks via /create-task para acompanhar o progresso
B) Executar agora mesmo sem criar tasks
```

- **Option A chosen** → invoke `/create-task` for each item, then `/next-task` to start item 1
- **Option B chosen** → invoke `/next-task` directly and begin executing from item 1
- **No issues found** → state that explicitly; do not ask and do not call `/next-task`

---

## Hard Constraints

- NEVER use `docs/ia/figma/*.json` or `DESIGN_SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md` as the design source — always MCP
- NEVER use arbitrary color values (`bg-[#E8132A]`) — always project tokens
- NEVER create new CSS variables without adding them to `src/app/globals.css`
- Figma px values for dimensions → Tailwind canonical (N/4 formula)
- `text-[Npx]` is allowed only for font sizes outside the named Tailwind scale
- Always call `/next-task` at the end if issues were found

## Support Skills

| Skill            | When to invoke                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/figma`         | To understand Figma MCP API before calling tools       |
| `/frontend-design` | To validate component quality and production-readiness |
| `/ui-ux-pro-max` | To check design standards: spacing, accessibility, rhythm |
| `/next-task`     | To execute the action plan after analysis              |

---

## Integration

**Optional step in:** `/next-task` cycle  
**Always uses:** Figma MCP (`get_design_context`, `get_screenshot`)  
**Never uses:** Local snapshot files as source of truth  
**Ends with:** `/next-task` action plan if issues found
